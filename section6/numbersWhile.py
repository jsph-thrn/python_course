# Print integer numbers starting from 0 and ending in 5. Use while cycle.

myNum = 0

# While cycle repeats a code block contained in the structure while a logical condition is meet.
# In this case, the condition is that myNum is greater or equal than 0 and less or equal 5.
# myNum acts as control variable as well.

while 0 <= myNum <= 5:
    print(myNum)
    myNum += 1

# Next code block is unused

# else:
#   print('End while cycle.')
